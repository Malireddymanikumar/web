          <p>The Nvidia CEO pointed out his company's past brushes with ruin. Huang said, "We have the benefit of building the company from the ground up and having not-exaggerated circumstances of nearly going out of business a handful of times."
            But it isn't just Nvidia that faces a perpetual threat, in Huang's view. He declared that "there are no companies that are assured survival. If you don't think you are in peril, that's probably because you have your head in the sand."</p>
